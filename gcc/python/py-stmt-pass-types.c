  Takes the toplevel decls and generates the type example:

  class foobar:
    def __init__ (self):
      self.attrib = x

  we dont need to generate types for normal things like local blocks
  as these will go out of scope anyways because of the python standard
  so we can leave these address's on the stack, this also goes for functions
  for functions it will just be a case of knowing which objects it has
  access to and passing the correct instances so proper scoping is preserved
  or we can pass them all as a naive way as normal static analysis should
  preserve the scoping standard.

  Will only care about the x and y expressions on the toplevel,
  leaving the class

  These structs for each class may eventaully be fleshed out with more
  information like member functions and eventually the base attributes
  like polymorphism stuff but we ignore this for now.
